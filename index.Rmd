## Principles for Data Interaction

### Wildly Rough and Unrefined Draft

- Data interaction is made possible by actions that the user takes, and 
reactions that the user experiences.
- There are generally three "modes" of interaction:
    - Individual
    - Group
    - Environment

## Example: Basic Interactive Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~hp, y = ~mpg, color = ~factor(cyl), text = rownames(mtcars))
```

## Example: Scrubbing Music
